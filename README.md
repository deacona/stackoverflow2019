## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project uses Python 3.7 - specifically the Anacaconda Miniconda distribution. All Python libraries used can be found in the requirements.txt file.


## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This project is intended to explore the 2019 stackoverflow survey results and answer some interesting questions about the data. The 3 main questions are

1. Who is the typical coder? (What are their attributes?) (Also who is the least typical?)
2. What makes data scientists stand out? (Can we predict which coders are data scientists?)
3. TBC?

The CRISP-DM process was followed to answer each question.

1. Business understanding
2. Data understanding
3. Data preperation
4. Modelling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

A summary of the findings can be found at TBC. Full details are in the code as described below.


## File descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Each question has it's own Jupyter notebook

* [Q1 TBC](Q1\ TBC.ipynb)
* [Q2 TBC](Q2\ TBC.ipynb)
* [Q3 TBC](Q3\ TBC.ipynb)

There are additional shared resources in the following Python modules

* TBC.py
* TBC.py
